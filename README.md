# 🚀 AppService

This project contains the full setup for deploying a web service (e.g., Flask or FastAPI) using Git and GitHub, along with steps to run the app and solve common version control issues.

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 📁 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Selak007/AppService.git
cd AppService
````

### ▶️ Run the App (Example using Python Flask)

> Make sure Python is installed on your machine.

```bash
# (Optional) Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
# source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
python app.py
```

> Replace `app.py` with the actual entry point file you're using (e.g., `main.py`, `run.py`).

## 🔧 Git & GitHub Setup

### Initial Git Commands (from a fresh folder)

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Selak007/AppService.git
git push -u origin main
```

---

## 🧱 Common Errors Faced and Fixes

### ❗ `fatal: not a git repository`

* **Cause**: Git commands were run before initializing a repo.
* **Fix**: Run `git init` in your project folder.

---

### ❗ `remote origin already exists`

* **Fix**: Remove and re-add the remote.

```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/Selak007/AppService.git
```

---

### ❗ `error: src refspec main does not match any`

* **Cause**: No commits yet, so `main` branch doesn’t exist.
* **Fix**:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

### ❗ `Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally`

* **Fix Option 1 (Safe):**

```bash
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

* **Fix Option 2 (Force Push – overwrite remote):**

```bash
git push -u origin main --force
```

---

### ❗ Vim Merge Conflict or Swap File Warning

* **Fix (inside Vim):**

  * Press `i` to enter insert mode
  * Write your message
  * Press `Esc`
  * Type `:wq` and press `Enter`
