# 🚀 AppService

This project contains the full setup for deploying a web service (e.g., Flask or FastAPI) using Git and GitHub, with steps to push code and manage version control locally.

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 📁 Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Selak007/AppService.git
cd AppService
▶️ Run the App (example using Python Flask)
Make sure Python is installed on your machine.

bash
Copy
Edit
# (Optional) Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
python app.py
Replace app.py with the actual entry point file you're using.

🔧 Git & GitHub Setup
Initial Git Commands
If you're starting from scratch in a local folder:

bash
Copy
Edit
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/Selak007/AppService.git
git push -u origin main
🧱 Common Errors Faced and Fixes
❗ Error: fatal: not a git repository
Cause: Ran Git commands before git init

Fix: Run git init in your project folder

❗ Error: remote origin already exists
Fix: Remove and re-add remote:

bash
Copy
Edit
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/Selak007/AppService.git
❗ Error: error: src refspec main does not match any
Cause: No commits yet, so main branch doesn’t exist

Fix:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
❗ Error: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do not have locally
Fix Option 1 (Safe):

bash
Copy
Edit
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
Fix Option 2 (Force Push, use with caution):

bash
Copy
Edit
git push -u origin main --force
❗ Vim Merge Conflict Message or Swap File Warning
Fix: Inside Vim,

Press i → write your message → Esc → type :wq → Enter

Let me know what your `app.py` or `main.py` does and I can add a better "Run the App" section or environment info
